## Define carbon footprint of data centers (E.Datacenter.1)

Carbon footprint of a data center is carbon emissions of a data center equivalent of the total amount of electricity consumed by the data center. 

## Switch TAHOE RENO, The Citadel Campus (E.Datacenter.2.b)

Switch is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. The company develops and operates the SUPERNAP data center facilities. 
The TAHOE RENO data center was announced in 2015 and opened its first center in February, 2017. 

Current : 
* Sqrt ft: 1.3 million square feet  
* Electricity Use: 130 MW  
* Energy Source : 100% Renewable

On Completion

## Other Renewable Energy - Marine/Oceans Energy (E.Datacenter.4)

Marine energy is a form of renewable energy generated from ocean waves, tides, difference in salinity gradients and ocean temperature differences. Marine energy can be of two types 1. Power from surface waves. 2. Tidal Power : Power from movement of water.

Marine Energy is latest form of renewable energy being used by dataceneters. Few datacenters using or plan to use 
Ocean's energy are:

**Microsoft(Scotland)**:
Micorsoft recently announced a submarine-like self conatained data center called Project Natick.

**LefDal Mine (Norway)**:
Lefdal Mine Data Center uses Sea Water for cooling.

**SIMEC Atlantis (Scotland)**:
The Atalantis new datacenter operating fully on tidal energy will be operational 2024.

## Google's efforts towards Renewable Energy (E.Datacenter.5)

Google, World's leading tech company, is the worldâ€™s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy. Google has actively persued 
the use of renewable engery to power the datacenters and offices. In 2016, the company was able to cover 57% of its energy use with
renewables and then Google signed long term contracts with solar and wind energy farms to purchase same amount of renewable energy 
it consumes for the year. Google has met the target for 2017 and 2018 years and expected to meet for 2019 as well
